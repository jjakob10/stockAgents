# CrewAI Stocks Analysis

This project leverages multiple AI-driven agents to analyze stock price trends and market news for a specific stock ticker, ultimately generating a well-informed and insightful newsletter. The agents are built using the `crewai` framework, and the application is hosted using Streamlit.

## Overview

The application performs the following tasks:

1. **Stock Price Analysis**: Fetches historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance and analyzes the trend.
2. **Market News Analysis**: Gathers recent news related to the stock and performs sentiment analysis to assess the market's mood.
3. **Newsletter Generation**: Combines the results from the stock price and news analysis to generate a comprehensive, easy-to-read stock analysis report.

## How It Works

1. The application uses a series of AI agents:

   - **StockPriceAnalyst**: Analyzes the historical stock price data.
   - **NewsAnalyst**: Analyzes the latest market news related to the stock ticker.
   - **StockAnalystWriter**: Generates a newsletter combining the insights from the stock price and news analysis.

2. The agents are organized into a crew, and tasks are assigned to them to perform in a hierarchical process.

3. The application runs through Streamlit, providing a user-friendly interface to input a stock ticker and receive a detailed analysis.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jjakob10/stockAgents.git
   cd crewai-stocks
   ```

2. **Install the required Python packages**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up your environment variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your OpenAI API key:

   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   ```

4. **Run the Application**

   Use the following command to start the Streamlit app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run crewai-stocks.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the application in your web browser (typically, it will be available at `http://localhost:8501`).

2. Enter the stock ticker you want to analyze in the sidebar.

3. Click "Run Research" to start the analysis.

4. View the results of the analysis directly within the application.

## Future Enhancements

- **Integration with more data sources**: Expand the scope by integrating additional financial and news APIs.
- **Improved Analysis Techniques**: Incorporate more sophisticated trend analysis methods.
- **User Authentication**: Add user authentication for personalized experiences.
